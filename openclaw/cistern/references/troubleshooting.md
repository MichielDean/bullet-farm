# Cistern Troubleshooting

## Castellarius Not Running

```bash
ct castellarius status
# If stopped:
ct castellarius start
# Or via systemd:
systemctl --user start cistern-castellarius
journalctl --user -u cistern-castellarius -f
```

## Droplet Stuck in a Stage

```bash
ct droplet show <id>          # Check status + last error
ct droplet restart <id>       # Retry the current stage
```

If repeatedly failing, check logs for the specific cataractae:
```bash
journalctl --user -u cistern-castellarius --since "1 hour ago"
```

### Droplet Repeatedly Failing with "backing off" Messages

If you see logs like `droplet=<id> backing off <seconds>s after <N> consecutive quick exits`, the session is exiting very quickly (≤30 seconds by default). This usually indicates:
- Missing or expired API credentials (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, etc.)
- Agent binary not found or permission denied
- Provider-side rejection (rate limit, invalid token, service unavailable)

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check the session output: `ct droplet peek <id>` (or `ct droplet peek <id> --snapshot` for completed sessions)
2. Verify credentials are set: `ct doctor` (checks env vars and API keys)
3. Check provider status: if it's a known outage, the Castellarius will detect it and hold all droplets at max backoff

**Provider Degradation:**
If you see `provider=<name> appears degraded — queued droplets will be held at max backoff on next dispatch`, the provider has experienced multiple failures across different aqueducts. The Castellarius backs off all droplets to reduce API hammering while the provider recovers. When the provider recovers (first successful session), backoff resets automatically.

If the provider remains degraded, investigate:
- Is the provider service actually down? Check its status dashboard
- Is authentication stale? Run `ct doctor --fix` to refresh tokens
- Rate limiting? Reduce concurrent aqueducts or add delays in cataractae timeouts

### Cataractae Signaled Recirculate But No on_recirculate Route Configured

If you see a diagnostic note like: `"cataractae 'foo' signaled recirculate but has no on_recirculate route configured"`, the droplet is blocked because an agent incorrectly used `ct droplet recirculate` instead of `ct droplet pass` or `ct droplet block`.

**Common causes:**
- Agent mistakenly called recirculate when the task was complete (should be `pass`)
- Agent called recirculate to report a blocking issue (should be `block` with notes)
- Aqueduct config is missing the `on_recirculate` route for this step (configuration error)

**Fix:**
1. Check the droplet notes to understand what the agent intended: `ct droplet show <id>`
2. If the agent's work is complete, approve it: `ct droplet note <id> "Approving..." && ct droplet pass <id>`
3. If there's a real issue blocking the droplet, escalate it: `ct droplet block <id> --notes "..."`
4. If the aqueduct config is wrong, fix the `aqueduct.yaml` routing for that step and recirculate the droplet manually back to the offending step

## Missing Skills (stage does nothing / skipped)

Castellarius loads skills from `~/.cistern/skills/`. If a skill is missing, the stage is skipped silently.

```bash
ls ~/.cistern/skills/          # Check what's installed
# Skills should be in the repo under skills/
```

If skills were added to the repo after your last sync, copy them manually:
```bash
cp -r <worktree>/skills/<skill-name> ~/.cistern/skills/
```

## Binary Out of Date

Castellarius self-restarts when it detects a new binary (mtime check). To force:

```bash
# Rebuild
cd <worktree-path>
PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH" go build -o ~/go/bin/ct ./cmd/ct/

# Then restart
ct castellarius restart
# or: systemctl --user restart cistern-castellarius
```

**Warning:** Never build from `~/cistern` directly if worktrees are in use — it diverges from origin and corrupts worktree state. Always build from a synced worktree.

## Worktree Corruption

If your worktree has diverged or has unexpected state:

```bash
cd ~/.cistern/sandboxes/cistern/lobsterdog
git status                           # Assess damage
git checkout -B lobsterdog-work origin/main  # Nuke and re-sync (loses local changes)
```

## Drought Protocol Not Running

Drought hooks run during idle periods. If they're not firing:

1. Confirm Castellarius is running: `ct castellarius status`
2. Check if the aqueduct has active droplets (drought only triggers when empty)
3. Check logs: `journalctl --user -u cistern-castellarius | grep drought`

## OAuth Token or API Key Expired

When using the claude provider, sessions may crash if the Claude OAuth token expires. When using other providers (codex, gemini, copilot), ensure your API key is current. `ct doctor` catches these issues before they become a mystery:

```bash
ct doctor
# When using claude provider:
# ✗ Claude OAuth token: expired 2h15m ago — run 'claude' interactively to refresh
# ✗ env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: not set

# When using other providers:
# ✗ env: OPENAI_API_KEY: not set (codex)
# ✗ env: GEMINI_API_KEY: not set (gemini)
```

To recover (claude provider):

1. Run `claude` interactively in a terminal — it will detect the expired token and prompt you to log in again
2. After refreshing, update `~/.cistern/env` with the new key and restart:
   ```bash
   # Edit the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY line:
   nano ~/.cistern/env
   # Then restart the Castellarius to pick up the new value:
   ct castellarius start
   # or: systemctl --user restart cistern-castellarius
   ```
3. Run `ct doctor` again to confirm both checks pass

For other providers, update the respective API key in `~/.cistern/env` and restart the Castellarius.

## Database Issues

The SQLite DB at `~/.cistern/cistern.db` is the source of truth.

Direct inspection (read-only, for diagnostics only):
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.cistern/cistern.db ".tables"
sqlite3 ~/.cistern/cistern.db "SELECT id, title, status FROM droplets ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

For direct status fixes (last resort only):
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.cistern/cistern.db "UPDATE droplets SET status='pending' WHERE id='<id>';"
```
